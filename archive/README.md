# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files that were used during development and testing but are no longer needed for the main application.

## legacy_pages/

Contains the original Streamlit pages that were used for testing and development:

- `1_Job_Tracker.py` - Legacy job tracker interface (functionality moved to main app.py)
- `2_AI_Assistant.py` - Legacy AI assistant interface (functionality moved to main app.py)  
- `3_Test.py` - Testing interface for AI models and functionality

These pages served their purpose during development but are no longer needed since all functionality has been consolidated into the main application (`app.py`).

## Safe to Delete

All files in this archive directory can be safely deleted in the future as they contain no unique functionality that isn't available in the main application.

**Created:** June 1, 2025
**Status:** Ready for deletion after verification that main app works correctly
