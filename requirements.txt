# Metal acceleration
# PyTorch uses the new Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend for GPU training acceleration. This MPS backend extends the PyTorch framework, providing scripts and capabilities to set up and run operations on Mac. The MPS framework optimizes compute performance with kernels that are fine-tuned for the unique characteristics of each Metal GPU family. The new mps device maps machine learning computational graphs and primitives on the MPS Graph framework and tuned kernels provided by MPS.
#
# Requirements
# Mac computers with Apple silicon or AMD GPUs
# macOS 12.3 or later
# Python 3.7 or later
# Xcode command-line tools: xcode-select --install
#
# 2. Install
# Anaconda
# conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch-nightly
# pip
# pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
# Building from source
# Building PyTorch with MPS support requires Xcode 13.3.1 or later. You can download the latest public Xcode release on the Mac App Store or the latest beta release on the Mac App Store or the latest beta release on the Apple Developer website. The USE_MPS environment variable controls building PyTorch and includes MPS support.
# 
# To build PyTorch, follow the instructions provided on the PyTorch website.
# 
# 3. Verify
# You can verify mps support using a simple Python script:
# 
# import torch
# if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
#     mps_device = torch.device("mps")
#     x = torch.ones(1, device=mps_device)
#     print (x)
# else:
#     print ("MPS device not found.")
# The output should show:
# 
# tensor([1.], device='mps:0')
